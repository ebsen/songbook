- Hanging indent: Apply left padding and negative text-indent.
- Get 'Songs' and menuLink button the same height. (Probably tighten Songs rather than button).
- Move entire navigation to left.

Older notes:
- uncss the CSS
- implement Yahoo's Pure
- dismiss menu on clicking title
- increase navigation width
- replace main.less with contents of side-menu.css
- factor out index into individual pages with Jade partials (remove outer `each` loop, apply template to just the one song)
