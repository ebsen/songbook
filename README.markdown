# Christian Songs for Little Children

A collection of songs we sing with the kids on Sundays. This is in case someone doesn't have a paper copy handy.

All songs included are in the public domain.

## Getting Started

These instructions assume you have [Git], [Node], and [Gulp] already installed. If you don't, follow the directions at those websites to install them.

The following commands are executed by typing them into Terminal (on the Mac) or whatever command-line interface comes with your machine:

1. Clone this repo with the command `git clone https://github.com/ebsen/songbook.git`. That will create a sub-directory called `songbook` containing the project files.
2. Switch to that directory with the command `cd songbook`.
3. Once inside the folder, run `npm install` to install our dependencies.

You'll only need to run the above commands once.

Once that's done, you can do a few things with this project:
- To start a local server on your machine for previewing this website, run `gulp serve` in the directory where you first cloned this project above.
- The command `gulp build` (or `gulp compile`) builds a complete copy of the site to upload to a web serve.
- Run `gulp commands` to see what else is available.

### Getting (More) Started
