# Christian Songs
## for Little Children

A collection of songs we sing with the kids in case someone doesn't have a paper copy handy. :-)

## Getting Started
This project uses a triumvirate of [Gulp], [Harp], and [BrowserSync]. It is some lovely stuff.

These instructions assume you have [Git] and [Node] already installed.

1. If it isn't already, install [Gulp] from the command line with `npm install -g gulp`.
2. Clone this repository (`git clone https://github.com/ebsen/songbook.git`) and change to the newly created sub-directory (`cd songbook`).
3. Inside the folder, run `npm install` to pull down the necessary dependencies, basically just our wonderful unicorns above.
5. Run `gulp serve` to spin up a local copy of the site or `gulp commands` to see what else is available.
4. Write code!

### Getting (More) Started
