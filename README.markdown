# Christian Songs for Little Children

A collection of songs we sing with the kids on Sundays. This is in case someone doesn't have a paper copy handy.

## Getting Started
### In case you wanna hack on this yourself or you're curious how it's put together
This project relies on three lovely tools: [Gulp], [Harp], and [BrowserSync].

These instructions assume you have [Git] and [Node] already installed.

Steps 1, 2, and 3 only need done once.

1. If it isn't already, install [Gulp] from the command line with `npm install -g gulp`.
2. Clone this repository (`git clone https://github.com/ebsen/songbook.git`) and change to the newly created sub-directory (`cd songbook`).
3. Inside the folder, run `npm install` to pull down the necessary dependencies, basically just our wonderful unicorns above.
5. Run `gulp serve` to spin up a local copy of the site or `gulp commands` to see what else is available.
4. Write code!

## Getting (More) Started
These instructions broadly share information from the instructions for our starter template, [static-boilerplate]. The instructions there contain more thorough, detailed notes on what's going on here.
